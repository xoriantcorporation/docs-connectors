==== Export Documents

An Export Documents operation allows to query a set of documents for export to your vault’s FTP Staging server. It is recommended to use Export Documents operation is separate asynchronous flow using Async Scope and passing payload with document ids. Using asynchronously the operation executes in separate flow thread, will wait for specified polling interval to poll the Job status until it gets successful while the main flow continues its process.

The exported documents are stored on FTP Staging area in folder hierarchy structure – *\{root}/\{userId}/\{jobId}/\{documentIds}/\{versions}*. The Export Documents operation will return job results as response. For example:
--------------------
[
  {
	"file": "/41601/249051/0_1/TestDocument.docx",
	"user_id__v": 1885110,
	"id": 249051,
	"responseStatus": "SUCCESS",
	"minor_version_number__v": 1,
	"major_version_number__v": 0
  },
  {
	"file": "/41601/249050/0_1/TestDocument.docx",
	"user_id__v": 1885110,
	"id": 249050,
	"responseStatus": "SUCCESS",
	"minor_version_number__v": 1,
	"major_version_number__v": 0
  },
  {
	"file": "/41601/249052/0_1/TestDocument.docx",
	"user_id__v": 1885110,
	"id": 249052,
	"responseStatus": "SUCCESS",
	"minor_version_number__v": 1,
	"major_version_number__v": 0
  }
]
--------------------

The above example shows attributes as under :
 
*file – "/{jobId}/{documentId}/{major-minor-version}/{filename}"*. It’s an absolute file path location on Vault FTP server staging area.
 
*user_id__v* –  It’s a Vault system user Id of an user whose credentials are configured in connector. The folder is created in the name of user Id prefix with *‘u’ (e.g: uXXXXXXX)* on Vault FTP server staging area root location and under which exported file is located – *(e.g: "/uXXXXXXX/{jobId}/{documentId}/{major-minor-version}/{filename}\)"*.

*id* – It’s a document Id of exported document file.

*major_version_number__v* – It’s a major version number of exported document file.

*minor_version_number__v* – It’s a minor version number of exported document file.

|===

*Use Input Parameters to Protect VQL Queries*

The Query operation is used to retrieve documents, object, workflow information from the Vault. The primary concept of this operation is to supply a VQL query and use DataWeave to supply the parameters:

In the above example, input parameters are supplied as key-value pairs, which you can create by embedding a DataWeave script. Those keys are used in conjunction with the semicolon character (:) to reference a parameter value by name. This is the recommended approach for using parameters in your VQL query.

The alternative is to directly write ` *<veevavault:vql>SELECT id, name__v, study__v FROM documents WHERE name__v = #[payload] </veevavault:vql>`*, but this is a very dangerous practice that is not recommended.

*Advantages of using input parameters to configure the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement this way:*

* The query becomes immune to VQL injection attacks.
* The connector can perform optimizations that are not possible otherwise, which improves the app’s overall performance.

==== Get Picklists

==== Spark Validator

The Spark Validator operation validates and verify spark message triggered from Vault with signature and public key. On successful validation and verification, the Spark message can be process further in Mule Flow as per business requirements. You can refer to https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#spark-messaging[Spark Messaging feature and functionalities] and setup for more details.

The output of Spark Validator operation is Spark attributes (optional) with Spark Message as it is received from Vault.

*Note* – Before triggering Spark message from Vault make sure to raise support ticket with Veeva Support to increase the time interval (say – 10 seconds) for Spark Message to resend/retry. By default, it is configured as 3 seconds which is less for Spark Validator to complete message validation and verification.

*Note* – As per Veeva Systems the public key (00001.pem) expires every two years. The customer gets notification well advanced about its expiry date, if you are using this operation in Mule application flow make sure that after public key expiration date you need to remove public key file from the path configured in field (Public Key Path) and it will create new public key file while execution. Otherwise Spark message verification would be failing as *INVALID_SPARK_MESSAGE*. The Mule application deployed on Cloudhub with default path need to restart for successful Spark Message verification.

=== Connector Operations SUCCESS and FAILURE response

The Veeva Vault Connector operation responses are based on the Veeva API success or failure response with an error. The connector returns SUCCESS response at HIGH LEVEL and SUCCESS or FAILURE at LOW LEVEL (it means connector operation is SUCCESS but some to documents/object records failed to create/update due to some irrelevant metadata pass in request. For e.g.:

* *SUCCESS with SUCCESS response*
--------------------
{

"responseStatus": "SUCCESS"
	"data":[
		{
			"id": 239026,
			"name__v": "E22611234--38483",
			"responseStatus": "SUCCESS"
		},
		{
			"id": 239025,
			"name__v": "Kick-off Meeting Material Updated12341234--81032",
			"responseStatus": "SUCCESS"
		}
	]
}
--------------------

* *SUCCESS with a FAILURE response*

--------------------
{
	"data": [
		{
			"external_id__v": "TEST-238924",
			"rendition_type__v": "imported_rendition__c",
			"id": 238924,
			"responseStatus": "FAILURE",
			"minor_version_number__v": 1,
			"errors": [
				{
					"type": "INVALID_DATA",
					"message": "Document not found [238924/0/1]."
				}
			],
			"major_version_number__v": 0
		},
		{
			"external_id__v": "TEST-238925",
			"rendition_type__v": "imported_rendition__c",
			"id": 238925,
			"responseStatus": "FAILURE",
			"minor_version_number__v": 1,
			"errors": [
				{
					"type": "INVALID_DATA",
					"message": "Document not found [238925/0/1]."
				}
			],
			"major_version_number__v": 0
		}
	],
	"responseStatus": "SUCCESS"
}
--------------------

The Veeva Vault operations throw an exception when Veeva APIs returns a FAILURE response. E.g:

* *FAILURE with an ERROR response*
--------------------
{
	"responseStatus": "FAILURE",+
	"errors": [
		{
			"type": "INVALID_DATA",
			"message": "Unknown relationship [reviewer__v]"
		}
	]
}
--------------------
On receiving above FAILURE response from Veeva APIs, the connector operations will throw an exception, which needs to be caught in Error Handling component within Mule flow. E.g.:

--------------------
**********************************************************************************
Message : An error occurred from the Veeva Vault API.
Error Code: INVALID_DATA.
Original Error Message: Unknow relationship [reviewer__v].
Error type : VEEVAVAULT:INVALID_DATA
**********************************************************************************
--------------------

Following are the Error codes that can be caught in Error Handling component

* VEEVAVAULT:API_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
* VEEVAVAULT:ATTRIBUTE_NOT_SUPPORTED
* VEEVAVAULT:INACTIVE_USER
* VEEVAVAULT:INVALID_DATA
* VEEVAVAULT:INVALID_DOCUMENT
* VEEVAVAULT:INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS
* VEEVAVAULT:MALFORMED_URL
* VEEVAVAULT:METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED
* VEEVAVAULT:NO_PERMISSION
* VEEVAVAULT:OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED
* VEEVAVAULT:PARAMETER_REQUIRED

=== Streaming and Pagination

All the operations (except Download Document) in connector returns an InputStream as payload with respective results based on operation output. Because of an InputStream is returned as payload Mule by default applies Streaming Strategies, please refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.2/streaming-about[Mule Streaming Strategies] in more details. You can find streaming strategies configuration in *Advanced* tab of connector operations.

image:../../assets/images/veevavault/veevavault-connector-streaming-pagination.png[image,width=601,height=124]

The following operations in connector provides pagination mechanism based on Mule standard pagination.

* link:#get-documents[*Get Documents*]
* link:#get-object-records[*Get Object Records*]
* link:#query[*Query*]
* link:#get-audit-details[*Get Audit Details*]

While using these above paginated operations make sure to place For-Each/Splitter to retrieve each object (metadata’s in JSON format) at a time. The pagination operations have fields – *Fetch Size and Batch Size.*

* *Fetch Size:* The Fetch Size is a limit number of records that can be retrieve in a page. The operation would return the pages with fetch size number of JSON object records. Note, in some cases, Veeva API’s auto-calculate fetch size (number of records on each page) based on record size accumulated exceed the standard record size. The operation will return calculated records on each page.
* *Batch Size:* The Batch Size is number of pages it would return in each batch and each page will have fetch size number of records. The operation would return number of records (metadata’s in JSON format) per batch is calculated as below, *e.g*.:
--------------------
Fetch Size set as *1000*
Batch Size set as *10*

Total records in vault say has *100,000* records then

Number of pages = Total records/Fetch Size
				= 100000/1000
				= 100 pages.
				
Number of pages per batch 	= Number of pages/Batch Size
							= 100/10
							= 10 pages per batch.
							
Number of Records per batch = Number of pages per batch * Fetch Size
							= 10 * 1000
							= 10,000 records.
							
Therefore, Number of records return per batch would be 10,000 records.
--------------------

The repeatable streams measure the buffer size in byte measurements, when handling objects the runtime measures the buffer size using instance counts.

In non-repeatable stream connector operation would returns stream as number of records per batch and in repeatable stream would returns all records in once, so when calculating the in-memory buffer size for repeatable auto-paging, you need to estimate how much memory space each instance takes to avoid running out of memory.
